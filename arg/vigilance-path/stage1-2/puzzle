Congratulations, maybe you are not such a lost cause after all. Now, any time you decrypt something, please try it against the Vigilance domain: h t t p colon slash slash g i f f dot m e slash. Everything is Case Sensitive.

The first word you seek is born from the letters:
A--N--N-A
You must represent it like the name of a person.

The second word you desire lie hidden in the numbers, case in lower:
Three--Eighteen--Nine--Five--Nineteen--Eight--Five--Eighteen--Nineteen--Five--Twelve--Six--Twenty--Fifteen--Nineteen--Twelve--Five--Five--Sixteen

Good luck.
