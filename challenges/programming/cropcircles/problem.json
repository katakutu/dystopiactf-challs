When they turned on their radio transceiver to report back to mission control, they received <a target=_blank href='/problem-static/programming/cropcircles/cropcircles.enc'>this</a> weird transmission which seems to be heavily encoded. We suspect extraterrestrial activity. Note: The last part of the flag is 15. Not 'fifteen' or 50.",
