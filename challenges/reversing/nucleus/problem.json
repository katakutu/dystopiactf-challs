Unfortunately that big head of his is only good for building potato cannons so he accidentally provided us with a <a target=_blank href='/problem-static/reversing/nucleus/flag.corrupt'>corrupted version</a> of the uncompressed file. Reverse engineer nucleus and retrieve the uncompressed file. Nucleus is hosted at: play.iwanttoplayaga.me:1447",
